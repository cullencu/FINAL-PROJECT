# Rugby Player Performance Analysis

## Question
**Is there a significant relationship between kicking accuracy and meters gained among top international rugby players?**

This project explores a simulated dataset of elite rugby players to investigate the connection between various performance metrics. I will use statistical tests such as a t-test, ANOVA, and correlation, along with three types of visualizations to understand these patterns.

## Data Preparation
Simulate data for 25 top rugby players.

## Data Exploration
Basic summary and visualization.

## Statistical Analysis
I used t-test, ANOVA, and correlation test.

## Conclusion
I explored performance data for 25 elite rugby players across different positions. My findings:
- **T-test** showed whether thereâ€™s a significant difference in meters gained between forwards and backs.
- **ANOVA** tested if tries vary significantly across positions.
- **Correlation** found how strongly kicking accuracy relates to meters gained.

The analysis helps highlight how different skills cluster in player roles, and how accuracy in kicking may influence overall play success.

There is a statistically significant and positive relationship between kicking accuracy and meters gained, although the strength of the correlation may vary by position. This implies that kicking accuracy can be a contributing factor to how much ground a player gains.
